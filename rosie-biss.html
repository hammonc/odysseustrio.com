<h2>ROSIE BISS</h2>

<p>As recitalist and former member of the Zehetmair quartet and trio, the European Music Project and the Scottish Ensemble, Rosie has played throughout Europe and America’s concert halls, broadcast on BBC Radio 3, Classic FM, WDR 3 and performed at major music festivals including Edinburgh, Aspen, Verbier and Schleswig-Holstein.</p>
<p>Busy though the WNO schedule is, playing in the orchestral pit, symphony and chamber concerts, and sometimes in costume and character as part of the opera, Rosie has also guest lead the cello sections of Bournemouth Symphony, BBC National orchestras of Wales and Scotland, City of Birmingham Symphony orchestra, English National Opera and Opera North, and the Royal Northern Sinfonia.</p>
<p>Away from the regular classical regime, Rosie has recorded albums with folk musicians Rachel Unthank and Troy Donockley and performed with the German Cabaret show “Ensemble Extravagance!”</p>
<p>Rosie studied at Cambridge University and The Cologne Musikhochschule under Maria Kliegel. Now a keen educator, Rosie teaches cello and chamber music at the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama, coaches for the National Children’s Orchestra, and gives masterclasses annually at Cellofest.</p>
