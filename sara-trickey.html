<h2>SARA TRICKEY</h2>

<p>Sara Trickey enjoys an exciting and diverse career as a solo violinist and chamber musician. Noted for her “fiery and passionate” performances (The Strad)  and her “beautifully refined tone” (Musical Opinion), she performs at many of the major UK festivals and venues, including in recent months the Presteigne, Alwyn, Oxford May Music,  York, and Wye Valley Chamber Music festivals. She plays regularly with pianist Dan Tong with whom she has recorded the Schubert Sonatinas to critical acclaim (“Irresistible!” – Barry Millington). A CD of Fauré and David Matthews has recently been released by Deux-Elles. She also made a world premiere recording of Mathias’ violin sonatas with Iwan Llewelyn Jones.</p>
<p>Sara has performed most of the repertoire for violin and orchestra, with orchestras that include the City of London Sinfonia and the Orchestra of St John’s  (“The Beethoven violin concerto was quite simply perfection” – Seen and Heard International).</p>
<p>She is a founder member of the Odysseus Piano Trio and the Joachim String Trio, the latter playing on gut strings. She is also currently a member of the mixed ensemble Sound Collective, and plays in a violin duo with Andrew Watkinson, leader of the Endellion Quartet. Prior to forming these groups, Sara led the Bronte String Quartet for six years, winning the Royal Overseas League competition and second prize in the Cremona International Quartet competition.</p>
<p>Sara studied with Camilla Wicks and also was very much influenced by her studies at IMS Prussia Cove. She read Classics at Trinity Hall, Cambridge and this continues to be a passion. She also enjoys teaching, primarily at the Junior Guildhall School of Music and Drama.</p>	<p>More information is available on Sara's <a href="http://saratrickey.com/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
