			<h3>Clare Hammond</h3>
			<p>Acclaimed by The Daily Telegraph as a pianist of “amazing power and panache”, Clare Hammond broadcasts regularly on BBC Radio 3 and, in 2013, made her recital debuts at the City of London, Cheltenham, Brighton and Presteigne Festivals. She has recently recorded two discs for BIS records, one of the complete piano works of Andzrej and Roxanna Panufnik, and performs regularly at the Wigmore and Bridgewater Halls. Her Purcell Room debut for the Park Lane Group concert series was praised by The Guardian for its “crisp precision and unflashy intelligence”. A passionate advocate of twentieth and twenty-first century music, Clare combines a formidable technique and virtuosic flair onstage with stylistic integrity and attention to detail. </p>
