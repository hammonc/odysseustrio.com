			<h3>Clare Hammond</h3>
			<p>Acclaimed as a pianist of “amazing power and panache” (<em>The Telegraph</em>), Clare Hammond is recognised for the virtuosity and authority of her performances and is developing a “reputation for brilliantly imaginative concert programmes” (<em>BBC Music Magazine</em>, ‘Rising Star’). In 2014 she gave debut performances at 7 festivals across Europe, including the ‘Chopin and his Europe Festival’ in Warsaw, world premieres of works by 10 composers, and three broadcasts for BBC Radio. Her performance at the Barbican Hall in April 2015 led the <em>Guardian</em> to describe her as a “dazzling athlete” while her latest disc release, ‘Etude’, has received unanimous critical praise for its “unfaltering bravura and conviction” (<em>Gramophone</em>).</p>
