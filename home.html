	<p>Formed in 2015, the Odysseus Piano Trio is developing a reputation as one of the most dynamic and distinctive ensembles to emerge in recent years. Comprising three musicians with very different interests, the trio brings a fresh perspective to core works of the repertoire while championing lesser known pieces.</p><p>Pianist Clare Hammond won the Royal Philharmonic Society’s ‘Young Artist’ Award for 2015, has released three internationally acclaimed discs for BIS Records and appeared as the young Miss Shepherd in the Alan Bennett film adaptation ‘The Lady in the Van’. Violinist Sara Trickey has been praised by The Strad for her “fiery and passionate” performance style, recently made world-premiere recordings of William Mathias for Naxos, and has a long-term collaborative relationship with composer David Matthews. Composer-cellist Gregor Riddell straddles the worlds of classical music and electronics, has recently performed a double cello concerto of his own composition in La Paz, Bolivia and is currently setting up an Oslo-based digital radio station.</p><p>Keen communicators, the trio have developed a three-concert ‘Introduction to the Piano Trio’ in collaboration with music historian and presenter Dr Katy Hamilton. They regularly lead masterclasses, give children’s concerts and present interactive workshops for schools that include singing, dancing and body percussion!</p>
