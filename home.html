	<p> After studies at Cambridge University and IMS Prussia Cove, and extensive chamber music experience with a number of ensembles, Sara, Gregor and Clare have established the Odysseus Piano Trio. While their repertoire encompasses core works for trio, they also aim to seek out less familiar pieces and to bring them to new audiences.</p><p>All members of the ensemble are keen communicators and enjoy interacting with audiences and students in pre- and post-concert talks, workshops and masterclasses.</p>
