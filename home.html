	<p> After studies at Cambridge University and IMS Prussia Cove, and extensive chamber music experience with a number of ensembles, Sara, Gregor and Clare have established the Odysseus Piano Trio. While their repertoire encompasses core works for trio, they also aim to seek out less familiar pieces and to bring them to new audiences. Their debut season in 2015 saw them perform at venues across the UK, including St David's Hall in Cardiff, and the Deal, Frome, Llandeilo and Rye Festivals.</p><p>All members of the ensemble are keen communicators and enjoy interacting with audiences in pre- and post-concert talks, children's workshops and masterclasses.</p>
